# Commands


## Initialization

```sh
mkdir Test
cd Test
ls -a
git init
ls -ltra ./git
```

By default - Working Directory Name is a Repository Name

```sh
git status
git stat
```
show git tips

```sh
touch README.md
git status
```
UNTRACKED

`git add ./README.md` - regexp patterns can be used

`git status`

`git commit -m "initial commit"`
description helps to undestand what's inside this commit, extremly usefull when reading history.

commit HASH - commit ID, if we need to use this commit then ID should be used.

`git status`

## Changing

```sh
echo "This is a Test GIT project" > README.txt
git status
git commit -a -m "Added README file content"
git status
```
Commit here - sends changed file to repo directly (does not work for new files)

## History

`git log`
short HASH - stores first 7 digits

```sh
git log --pretty=format:"%h %cd %an '%s'"
git log --patch -2
```
Show differences between commits

## Remote branches

`origin/master` - differences between local version and remote

`origin` - name can be changed, you can work with different repositories thus many pointers may be used.

`git remote show` - shows what's happening with remote repo

## Merge / Commit

### Fast-forward

```sh
git checkout -b fix13
git status
touch fix13.txt
git add .
git status
git commit -m "Initial commit of fix13 branch"
git log --pretty=format:"%h %cd %an '%s'"
```

`ls -ltrh` - show files in the filesystem for this branch

`git checkout master` 

`ls -ltrh` - show filesystem again (snapshots)

CAUTION: Do not use branches for content splitting.

`git merge fix13` see fast-forward

`git log --pretty=format:"%h %cd %an '%s'"`

### Simple Three-way (recursive)

```sh
git checkout -b fix14
echo "It's Fix 14 branch" > fix14.txt
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit for fix14 branch"
```

`ls -ltrh` - file is here

`git checkout master` - no file here

`echo "Two branches was added to this repository" >> README.txt` - adding changes

`git commit -a -m "Added the second line into README.txt"`

`git log --graph --oneline --decorate --all`

`git merge fix14` - editor should appear to insert comment

`git log --graph --oneline --decorate --all` - cons: history mixed up

One more branch:

```sh
git checkout -b fix14
echo "It's Fix 15 branch" > fix15.txt
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit for fix15 branch"
git checkout master
echo "Fix 15 branch was added to the repository" >> README.txt
git commit -a -m "Added the third line into README.txt"
git checkout fix15
echo "It's a second line for the file" >> fix15.txt
git commit -a -m "Second commit for Fix15 branch"
git checkout master
```

`git log --graph --oneline --decorate --all -7` - two branches master with commit and Fix15 with two commits

`git rebase Fix15` - Master << Fix15

`git log --graph --oneline --decorate --all -7`- solid line instead of two

Previous commit disapeared, new commit added - both of them have same comments.

### Why it's recommended not doing rebase ?

First show that all the files exist

`ls -ltrh`

Answer: previous commit hash disapeared (where HEAD was). 
If someone has already created branch from this commit. Then we'll have commits without parents.
Git allows workarounding this.
